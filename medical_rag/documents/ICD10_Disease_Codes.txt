Quick Search Help
Quick search helps you quickly navigate to a particular category. 
    It searches only
titles, inclusions and the index
and it works by starting to search as you type and 
    provide you options in a dynamic dropdown list.
You may use this feature by simply typing the keywords that you're looking for 
    and clicking on one of the items that appear in the dropdown list. The system 
    will automatically load the item that you've picked.
You may use wildcards '*' as well to find similar words or to simply save some 
    typing.
For example,
tuber* confirmed
will hit both 
    tuberculosis and tuberculous together with the word 'confirmed'
If you need to search other fields than the title, 
    inclusion and the index then you may use the advanced 
    search feature
You may also use ICD codes here in order to navigate to a known ICD category.
The colored squares show from where the results are found.
(
green:Title,
blue:inclusions,
orange:index,
red:ICD code)
You don't need to remeber the colors as you may hover your mouse on these 
    squares to read the source.
